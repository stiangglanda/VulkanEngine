# VulkanEngine
![Build Status](https://github.com/stiangglanda/VulkanEngine/actions/workflows/cmake-single-platform.yml/badge.svg)

A graphics engine that uses the Vulkan API.
Currently, there is only the project set up with CMake, Github Actions and some basic dependencies.
It shows a small sample that implements rendering an obj model with Vulkan in one file.

The plan is to use the engine primarily for voxel rendering.
